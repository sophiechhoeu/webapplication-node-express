## Node js and Express

- Node js is a run time application that uses the same engine as the Chrome browser.

- it lets you build website applications with Javascript on the server side.

- Uses asynchronous event driven model ie when you perform a task node doesn't prevent other things from happening (called non-blocking) which in turn makes it fast

- it makes server requests super fast because the event model doesn't block other things from happening like traditional servers.

- Express.js - adds web server functionality to node.js

- Express creates a routing mechanism so that applications can pass along different requests easily.

- uses GET PUT Delete and allows for the a simple API (application programming inferface)

- Express also allows you to use other modules into into the middle of the framework to perform certain tasks (also known as middleware)
